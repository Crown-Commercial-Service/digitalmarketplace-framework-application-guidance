<h1 id="the-dates-for-the-framework-are-decided">The dates for the framework are decided</h1>
<p>For the frameworks we currently host on the Digital Marketplace, the framework authority is the Crown Commercial Service (CCS). We work as a multi-disciplinary team with CCS on the G-Cloud and DOS frameworks and decide the dates for the framework together. </p>

<p>CCS arranges for a prior information notice (PIN) to be published in the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU) announcing when the framework will open for applications. </p>

<p>This can happen up to 12 months before applications open. The amount of warning suppliers are given depends on:  </p>

<ul>
<li>the size of the framework<br></li>
<li>how much itâ€™s changed from the previous version of the framework<br></li>
<li>how much time the suppliers need to prepare<br></li>
</ul>

<p>CCS also arranges for a contract notice to be published in the OJEU on the day the framework opens. </p>
<h1 id="we-prepare-the-documents">We prepare the documents</h1>
<p>In the months before the framework opens we prepare three types of content: </p>

<ul>
<li>the legal documents that support the framework</li>
<li>the questions we ask suppliers within the Digital Marketplace service </li>
<li>the guidance on GOV.UK</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="legal-documents">Legal documents</h2>
<p>There are three legal documents that support the framework:</p>

<ul>
<li>the framework agreement</li>
<li>the call-off contract </li>
<li>the invitation to apply</li>
</ul>

<p>A content designer drafts the framework agreement and call-off contract with a subject-matter expert from either CCS or GLD. The product manager, content designer, lawyer from GLD and two people from CCS review it together each week.</p>

<p>The invitation to apply is drafted by CCS. </p>
