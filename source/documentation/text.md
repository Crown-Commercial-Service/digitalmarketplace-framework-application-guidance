# The dates for the framework are decided   

For the frameworks we currently host on the Digital Marketplace, the framework authority is the Crown Commercial Service (CCS). We work as a multi-disciplinary team with CCS on the G-Cloud and DOS frameworks and decide the dates for the framework together. 

CCS arranges for a prior information notice (PIN) to be published in the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU) announcing when the framework will open for applications. 

This can happen up to 12 months before applications open. The amount of warning suppliers are given depends on:  

+ the size of the framework  
+ how much itâ€™s changed from the previous version of the framework  
+ how much time the suppliers need to prepare  

CCS also arranges for a contract notice to be published in the OJEU on the day the framework opens.
