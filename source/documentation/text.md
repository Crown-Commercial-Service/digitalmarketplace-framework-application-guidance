# The dates for the framework are decided   

For the frameworks we currently host on the Digital Marketplace, the framework authority is the Crown Commercial Service (CCS). We work as a multi-disciplinary team with CCS on the G-Cloud and DOS frameworks and decide the dates for the framework together. 

CCS arranges for a prior information notice (PIN) to be published in the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU) announcing when the framework will open for applications. 

This can happen up to 12 months before applications open. The amount of warning suppliers are given depends on:  

+ the size of the framework  
+ how much itâ€™s changed from the previous version of the framework  
+ how much time the suppliers need to prepare  

CCS also arranges for a contract notice to be published in the OJEU on the day the framework opens. 

# We prepare the documents 
In the months before the framework opens we prepare three types of content: 

+ the legal documents that support the framework
+ the questions we ask suppliers within the Digital Marketplace service 
+ the guidance on GOV.UK

## Legal documents
There are three legal documents that support the framework:
  
+ the framework agreement
+ the call-off contract 
+ the invitation to apply

A content designer drafts the framework agreement and call-off contract with a subject-matter expert from either CCS or GLD. The product manager, content designer, lawyer from GLD and two people from CCS review it together each week.

The invitation to apply is drafted by CCS.
